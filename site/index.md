## Our Solution

### Bespoke

> Every team is different, so we don't offer a one-size-fits-all solution.

We get embedded in your team, establish the root cause of your problems, and implement tooling and workflows that work for _your_ team.

### Technical

> A team can only be as effective as their tooling lets them be.

Code en Place isn't a top-down management solution like agile or scrum, it's a bottom up rethinking of the automation and tooling at the core of your developer's day-to-day.
